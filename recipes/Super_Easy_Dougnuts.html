            <li>⅜ cup milk  </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shortening  </li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract  </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt  </li>
            <li>1 quart oil for deep frying </li>
            <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting  </li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the vinegar into the milk, and let stand for a few minutes until thick.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla until well blended. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the sugar mixture alternating with the vinegar and milk. Roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/3 inch thickness. Cut into doughnuts using a donut cutter. Let stand for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry doughnuts in the hot oil until golden, turning over once. Drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioners' sugar while they are still warm, and serve immediately.</li>
